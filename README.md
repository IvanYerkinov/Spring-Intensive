## Eye4Color

This is a python console application that processes image files and outputs suggested color palettes in an RGB format.

#### Before use:
Download the eye4color.py and palette.py files and place them in the same directory.
Place any image files you wish to process in the same directory as the two files.


#### Dependencies:
PILLOW


### Use:
Call the following command in the console:

> python3 eye4color.py [image-file names]

Replace the [image-file names] with the names of the images you want to process.
The program can process multiple at once, just separate their names with a space.
For example:

> python3 eye4color.py test.png test2.png test3.jpg

The program should output the results of its analysis onto the console.

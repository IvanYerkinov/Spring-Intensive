# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

## TODO: copy this file, fill it out, and push it up to your project's repo.

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name: Konstantin Kishinsky**


**Project Name: Eye4Color**


**Is your project New or Old?**
This is a new project


**Is your project Solo or Team?**
Solo


## Description

The goal of this project is to create a program that will analyze the color composition of images and output the result of the analysis to the user. Furthermore the program will also recommend a color palette that would work well in accommodating the images that it analyzed.

This project is built for artists and web-designers. It will allow them to check the color composition of their images and get color palettes that are created specifically just for their work.

## Challenges I Anticipate

The hardest part of the program I feel would be writing the math that would be used to analyze the images as well as the program that creates the color palette. Since both require specific math around colors, the use of which is intrinsically tied to the human eye and artist interpretation.

## Skateboard

Build a program that takes in one image and outputs a basic analysis on the average color of the image, the absolute average color, the most prevalent color, and least prevalent color.
**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.**

## Bike
Build the program that will output a suggested color palette for the image(s).

## Car
Integrate the program into a website, into which users can upload images to get this sort of analysis.

# Juniors Spring Intensive Deliverable Proposal

## TODO: copy this file, fill it out, and push it up to your project's repo.

Dates 3/16-3/25

**My Name: Konstantin Kishinsky**


**Project Name: Pixelbot**


**Is your project New or Old?**
This is a new project


**Is your project Solo or Team?**
Solo


## Description

This is a new project I will be starting. The goal of this project is to create a program that uses a Markov Chain to generate images. I want to do this because it is a technical project that focuses on using a program to create things via probability and it expands on all the concepts I have studied in programing thus far.

## Challenges I Anticipate

The hardest part of this project will be manipulating image files to both read and write pixels into and from them.
Also making the program output coherent images rather than ones created through pure probability.
Optimizing the program to run quickly would also be another challenge faced throughout the entirety of the project.

## Skateboard

Build a program that takes in one image and outputs an image based on the structure of the first.

**Start coding and finish “Skateboard” feature before beginning “Bike”.**

## Bike
Allow the program to take in multiple images to build one.

## Car
Allow the user to set N length of the markov chain, and the dimensions of the output image.

## Wireframes

**Insert wireframe pictures here**
